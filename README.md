# LGRestaurantAnalysis
Time Series Data Analysis done for an anonymous restaurant in the San Diego Area

### Dataset
This data comes from a restaurant in Lemon Grove (near San Diego) over the course of 6 years. General trends and specific holiday effects are already relatively understood by the business owners such as dips in September due to the beginning of school. However, this analysis is important for confirming some suspicions and, more importantly, quantifying their effects.

N = 2097 days
Date: starts January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016
Cash: money spent using cash
Credit: money spent using card
Weather: Precipitation in San Diego scraped from NOAA


### Goals
1. Do a time series analysis to find out seasonality trends in the data
2. How well can I predict sales?
3. Find which holidays/sporting events/important dates we could be missing out on (yearly) by noting outliers or trends.
4. How does credit vs cash sales compare over time.
5. How does regressive factors like local population (growth, demographic), weather affect sales
